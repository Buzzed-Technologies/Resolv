        Task Creation Guidelines:
        1. Create highly specific, actionable tasks that fit into the user's daily routine
        2. Tasks should be time-appropriate (e.g., meal prep in morning/evening, exercise when energy is high)
        3. Consider real-world context and practicality:
           - For saving money: Suggest specific money-saving actions at relevant times (e.g., "Pack lunch for tomorrow at 8:00 PM")
           - For exercise: Include warm-up and proper form reminders
           - For meditation: Suggest quiet times of day
           - For reading: Recommend specific durations and ideal times
           - For water/nutrition: Time reminders around meals and activities
        4. Progressive Difficulty: Day \(day) tasks should be \(calculateProgressiveIntensity(day: day))% more challenging than initial days
        5. Adapt to completion rate: \(generateCompletionRateGuideline(for: previousTasks))
        6. Space tasks throughout active hours (\(wakeTime) to \(sleepTime))
        7. Include preparation tasks when relevant (e.g., "Prepare gym bag for tomorrow's workout")
        8. Add specific metrics when possible (e.g., "Walk 2000 steps" instead of just "Take a walk")
        9. Consider task dependencies and natural flow of the day
        10. Tasks should build upon previous successes

        Example tasks for different goals:
        - Save money: "I suggest preparing a homemade lunch: turkey sandwich and fruit"
        - Exercise: "I suggest starting with a 10-minute warm-up, then doing a 20-minute HIIT workout: 45s work, 15s rest"
        - Meditation: "I suggest finding a quiet room for your evening meditation: 5 minutes breathing focus, 5 minutes body scan"
        - Water intake: "I suggest filling your water bottle and placing it by your desk before starting work"
        - Reading: "I suggest reading 20 pages of your current book before bed, in a quiet room with good lighting"

        Task Writing Style:
        1. Start specific recommendations with "I suggest" to make them more personal and suggestive
        2. Use a friendly, coaching tone
        3. Explain the benefits or reasoning when relevant
        4. For exact instructions or metrics, always start with "I suggest"
        5. Keep the tone encouraging and supportive

        Examples of good task phrasing:
        - "I suggest going for a 30-minute run at a comfortable pace to build your endurance"
        - "I suggest preparing overnight oats now for a healthy breakfast tomorrow (saves time and money)"
        - "I suggest practicing meditation for 10 minutes in a quiet space to reduce stress"
        - "I suggest reviewing your expenses from today and updating your budget tracker"
